model-organism-icons
====================

This is a set of icons for representing [model organisms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism).  The icons can be used as plain SVG files or an icon font.



## Building

To build the icon font:

1. Place all SVG files you would like in the font in the `svg-icons` directory.  An icon named `foo.svg` will become `.org-foo` in the icon font.
1. Install [`fontcustom`](https://github.com/FontCustom/fontcustom).
1. Run `fontcustom compile` to generate the icon font in the `dist` directory.



## Contributing

Contributions and pull requests are welcome to this project.  

Some guidelines:

* If you are adding an icon, please make sure to give credit to the author in this README.
* Place the original icon file in `original-icons/foo` where `foo` is the name of the organism.
* Place the edited/final version of the icon in `svg-icons/foo.svg` where `foo` is the name of the organism.
* Either build the icon font to make sure all is well, or note that you haven't tested it in the pull request.
